> “Code in silence. Defend in shadows.”

Welcome to my digital domain. I'm a dedicated Network Analyst and cybersecurity enthusiast with a growing arsenal of technical skills and a sharp eye for threat detection. I’m building out a full-scale cybersecurity lab featuring:

- **Virtualized Environments** (VMware Workstation)
- **SIEM Tools** (Security Onion, Wazuh)
- **Firewalls & IDS/IPS** (pfSense, Suricata)
- **Offensive Security** (Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap)
- **Defensive Strategy** (Log analysis, Threat hunting, Forensics)

### Current Projects:
- **Home Lab Deployment** – Building secure, segmented lab networks for defense training and testing.
- **Threat Intel Tracker** – Personal system for mapping, monitoring, and archiving indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Tools & Scripts** – Bash, PowerShell, and Python snippets for everyday analysis and automation.

### On a mission to:
- Track and analyze digital threats.
- Build resilient systems and networks.
- Grow from student to silent guardian in the cyber domain.
